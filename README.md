## Background
Vengo, a New York based company, has created a network of over 1000 digital vending kiosks across the US.
Our machines connect brands and consumers in locations previously inaccessible to retail such as gyms, colleges, and hotels.
Our software enables each brand to customize the user experience they want to present to consumers.
We accomplish this by embedding a Chromium-based browser within our .NET application.
