## Background
Vengo, a New York based company, has created a network of over 1000 digital vending kiosks across the US.
Our machines connect brands and consumers in locations previously inaccessible to retail such as gyms, colleges, and hotels.
Our software enables each brand to customize the user experience they want to present to consumers.
We accomplish this by embedding a Chromium-based browser within our .NET application.

## Example
Brands and media agencies are required to conform to our asset guidelines when providing creative.
These guidelines can be found at our software integration site: [`https://vengolabs.app/network/sampling/`](https://vengolabs.app/network/sampling/).
The _Example User Journey_ displayed on that site represents a typical user flow.
An interactive version of this journey is available at this demo site: [`https://vengolabs.com/demo/clinique_id/`](https://vengolabs.com/demo/clinique_id/).
The source for this user journey is presented in the example folder of this repository.
